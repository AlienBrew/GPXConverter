GPXConverter
============

Converter to translate Garmin eTrex GPX files into Garmin Edge 800 TCX files

Converter was concieved to allow Heart Rate and Cadence data that are supported
by the eTrex 30 to be input in the Strava tracking website. But the converter 
should work for any tracking site that uses the tcx format.

Note: Edge 800 is emulated for it's Altimeter, which the eTrex 30 has as well.
